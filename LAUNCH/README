This folder should contain all launching scripts for various programes like Gaussian etc.
It does not contain system-wide scripts from Polach (like M12_SP).

All scripts should work on all clusters in our laboratory,
i.e. if there are different versions or locations of the program (like G09.A02 on as67 versus G09.D02 on a324),
the script should automatically handle it.

However, the program paths and settings should come from SetEnvironment.sh global  script.

=====================================================
Use the following to get environmental variables from the $USER
#$ -V
SetEnvironment.sh MOLPRO   #SetEnvironment.sh must be in $PATH 



=====================================================
Use the following code to determine the cluster name:

if [[ "$node" =~ s[0-9] ]] || [[ "$node" -eq "as67-1" ]];then
   cluster=as67
elif [[ "$node" =~ a[0-9] ]] || [[ "$node" -eq "403-a324-01" ]];then
   cluster=a324
else
   echo "I did not recognize any of the PHOTOX clusters. Please check the script $0"
   echo "Exiting..."
   exit 1
fi

if [[ "$cluster" -eq "as67" ]];then
   code for as67
else if [[ "$cluster" -eq "a324" ]];then
   code for a324
fi
